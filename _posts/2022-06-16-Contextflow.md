Radiology is currently facing some serious global challenges: increasing workloads and complexity of diagnosis, alongside a global radiologist shortage. [In 2010, radiologists reviewed 15,000 images a day; by 2018 that number had tripled](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cancer-scans-left-unread-for-weeks-dk6chgggk). In the UK alone, estimates indicate a shortage of 1,939 radiology consultants, leading to a current cost of outsourcing or ad-hoc solutions that [has grown to £206 million per year](https://www.rcr.ac.uk/system/files/publication/field_publication_files/clinical-radiology-uk-workforce-census-2020-report.pdf). These factors can lead to delays, missed findings, and high overtime or outsourcing expenses. [contextflow](https://contextflow.com/) uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to power its clinical decision support system that can help radiologists diagnose patients faster and with more accuracy. The software can search, retrieve, and compare historical diagnostic data to help guide radiologists in writing reports. It is currently being utilized to analyze lung computed tomography (CT) scans for interstitial lung diseases (ILD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer screenings.
